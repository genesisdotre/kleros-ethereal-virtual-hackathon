### Cpt Obvious tip

Have the same mnemonic each time, to preserve settings in MetaMask:
* `ganache-cli -m "____ ____ ____ ____" //` 

### Minimal Usability Requirements
* No MetaMask required to browse the site.
* No login button unless necessary.
* Detecting mainnet / kovan.
* Detecking account and network change.
* Detecting cancelled transactions.
* Disabling the button as the transaction is mining.
* Display link to the transaction on Etherscan
### Tests

YES. There will be. I love testing.
