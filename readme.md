# Kleros Ethereal Virtual Hackathon

(UNFORMATTED)

// Daily challenge

It takes ___ days to build habit

It's a freedom but we suggest 30.

You submit 



You commit to do 30 workouts in 30 days.

Ideally 1 per day to build a habit, but we don't really want to steal your money.

But... Sometimes life happens.

1. Early morning international flight across several timezones
2. Battery on the phone dying
3. Running out of storage
4. Not pressing record button
5. Internet too slow to upload
6. Anything really...

It is OK to upload 2 videos a day later. If you do 30 workouts in 30 days and you miss one day and 2x the following one - it's OK with me, it's perfectly acceptable outcome.

It may happen that jurors will reject the submission.

To keep it simple - we are not doing an appeal process. It's $1m on the line, it's a workout that you can do in 15 minutes. Just do it again and this time make sure 

To keep it simple - one challenge per address at a time. Building habits is difficult. Build one habit at a time. If you are really hardcore - you'll find a workaround of creating multiple addresses, identities.

This time in a decentralized manner.

### Cpt Obvious tip

Have the same mnemonic each time, to preserve settings in MetaMask:
* `ganache-cli -m "____ ____ ____ ____" //` 





### Tests
YES. There will be. I love testing.
